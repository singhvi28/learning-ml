# Learning ML

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I implement Machine Learning models from scratch! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey in learning and understanding the core concepts of Machine Learning by coding the algorithms step by step without relying on pre-built libraries.

## Objectives
- Develop a deeper understanding of Machine Learning algorithms.
- Demonstrate proficiency in implementing algorithms from scratch.
- Share my journey and progress publicly to engage with the ML community.

### Supervised Learning
<b>Linear Regression</b>: 
- Implemented Linear Regression from scratch using Numpy.
- Calculated weights and bias for the California Housing dataset.

<b>Logistic Regression</b>: (coming soon)
- Implemented Linear Regression from scratch using Numpy.
- Performed training and testing on the Titanic Dataset for survival prediction.
